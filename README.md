From college students to industry leaders, most women in tech share the isolating experience of being the first or only woman in the room. In these spaces, there's often an unspoken feeling that we have to be twice as good to be seen as half as competent. Every technical contribution feels like it's being scrutinized more carefully, and it isn't enough to just be average. That feels like failure, and unfortunately, it might confirm someone's biases.

Women leave tech at a rate 45% higher than men, with 56% exiting the industry 10-20 years into their careers. Lack of career growth, poor management, and the absence of mentorship are cited as major factors. We built SheConnects to break that cycle by creating a space where women can find mentors who've walked the path before them, connect with peers facing similar challenges, and build the support network that the tech industry has failed to provide. Because no one should have to navigate this journey alone.

Our platform connects women already in the industry who are looking to mentor other women in various stages of their career to women who want to better navigate male-dominated spaces while advancing their own career with the help of a more experienced perspective. On SheConnects, users have their own profile with their contact info, skills, external interests, and a bio; with this, they can browse through and connect with other mentors/mentees as well as make community posts that all users can see and respond publicly to. This platform facilitates the growth of women’s careers and skills in spaces where they are not always welcomed, providing invaluable opportunities and helping establish a deeper sense of unity.
